Personal Blog using Django, Twitter Bootstrap and Amazon's ec2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code for my personal blog http://www.reemachugani.com/ which is being served by Amazon's ec2 instance. You can read about hosting your django website on Amazon and more in my blog post. 

The sleek interface is owing to the bootstrap.css and .js files which are not added in this repo, but a recent version of those can be easily downloaded from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ and added in the respective static/css and static/js folders.
